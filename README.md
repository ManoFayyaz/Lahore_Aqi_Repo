***Please download jupyter notebook file to see all the progress of my work***

  Thank you!
  
***The working code is in other files for ci/cd pipeline to work.***

I did not know how to upload jupyter notebook file so I uploaded it directky from my pc and it does not show content on this. That is why I request you to download it before evaluation of my whole progress; code basically. When downloaded, you will be able to see all the EDA and Model Training code.

The code that worked; I transferred it from my notebook and put it in python files in github repo to create a ci/cd workflow for the first time.
